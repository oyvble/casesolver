tip.export;Export table to a textfile
tip.data.changeview;Change table layout for evidence versus references (horizontal or vertical).
tip.data.import;Import data from selected case. Alternatively it is also possible to edit name of case and press ENTER.
tip.data.importref;Import additional reference(s) to session by selecting a textfile (requires EFM/LRmix format)
tip.data.compare;Triggers the comparisons between Mixtures (and evidence(s) with emtpy MatchStatus) and references. This is an investigatory comparison search where match-candidates are obtained based on thresholds (see threshold settings). The results are shown in the next panels, and the final candidate list is shown under Matches
tip.data.createreport;Create a report with results conducted in the session. Modify report in Report settings. Different report formats are supported.
tip.data.selectprofiles;Conduct further analysis with selected (highlighted) profiles (evid/refs): Show, delete, export or perform deconvolution
tip.data.rmp;Calculate random man not excluded (RMNE) and random match probability (RMP) of reference profiles
tip.data.ibs;The number of shared alleles between all references are calculated (Identical By State). Only pairs which obtains a value above specified IBS threshold are shown.
tip.data.conc;The number of shared alleles between all evidences are calculated (concordance). Only pairs which obtains a value above specified MAC threshold are shown.
tip.data.editref;Edit name or alleles of any of the references. Also possible to add new references.
tip.data.restart;Restart program session (all panels are cleared).
tip.matchmatrix.truncate;Truncate cells which has a value below the specified MAC threshold.
tip.matchlistQual.calc;Calculate the quantitative based LR for all candidates being above the QualLR threshold
tip.matches.woe;Define and perform weight of evidence calculations based on user-defined hypotheses. The LR values may also take into account theta/Fst-correction.
tip.matches.dcall;Performing deconvolution of all evidence profiles in the matchlist having at least one unknown. The deconvolution will condition on the matchcandidates.
tip.dc.exportsel;Export selected profile to a EFM/LRmix supported textfile.
tip.dc.delete;Delete row in table
tip.dc.showprobs;Show the ratioToNext='probability of top ranked candidate divided by the probability of the second ranked candidate', where candidates are whole genotypes. Single alleles may be extracted if below specified DC genotype-setting but above allele-setting.
tip.dc.addasref;Move selected profile (row) to the reference table in the data panel. The user may change the name (followed by ENTER).
tip.woe.lrpermarker;Show LR per marker (based on MLE calculations)
tip.woe.paramest;Show estimated parameters
tip.woe.modelvalid;Show model validation plots
tip.woe.fittedPH;Show fitted peak height model (either for Hp and Hd). For unknown contributors the genotypes are conducted as the top-ranked genotype (from deconvolution).
tip.woe.statement;Show and edit statement for selected hypothesis set. It is possible to edit the statement here before creating report.
tip.woe.cons;(Re)Calculate conservative LR for selected hypothesis set (MCMC)
tip.woe.delete;Delete selected row
