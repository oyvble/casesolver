Suggestive updates: 
 - Better info about working progress.
 - Introduce new column for References called "Type": Known (imported), SingleSource (given as Unknown#), DC (Added through Deconvolution), Added (Added manually)
   OR: Typed,SingleSource (given as unknown),DCed (added after DCing).
  --  Gives Added option in Report Layout: Optional whether to show SingleSource (unknowns) and DCed profiles in references (these are already separated). 
 - In report: Separate known reference profiles from unknown, deconvolved.
 - Profile manipulation:
  -- Collapse similar Refs (from IBS). Useful for reducing number of unknowns.
  -- Delete selected evid profiles (before comparison). Useful to remove non-relevant profiles.

 - Possibly bugs:
  -- When doing DC after single quanLR calculations and REF is removed.
  -- Identical references not removed if different names? Example Case 7154
  -- When creating report with QuanLR matchlist but QuanLR not selected as model.

- Fix bug in plotEPG2 when partial profile (ymax=NA?)

#Changes version 1.6.1
 - New feature: Mix-mix allele comparison based on alleles. Proportion of coordance between all pairwise evid profiles. The MAC threshold is used to extract candidates. Results can be shown in report ("Show concordant evidence" added to report layout)
 - Single sources with corresponding assigned unknown will not be shown in "Matches" anymore.
 - Matches based only on allele comparison is now possible. LR can now be avoided by not defining pop frequencies (not recommended).
 - Minor changes:
  -> Previous calculated LR-results are removed when clicking compare (avoiding errors).
  -> Added row-index for IBS and evid. concordance comparisons.
  
#Changes version 1.5.0
 - Backward compatibility: Older CaseSolver projects can now be opened in new version.
 - Single source profiles (not matching any refs) can now also be compared in "Compare" (by default). This can be turned on under "Advanced->Advanced options". 
 - CaseSolver now has a "SNP mode" which can be activated under "Advanced->Advanced options". 
  -> This will treat all evid profiles as mixtures, and number of contr is assumed equal 3 when using the Quan model.
 - CaseSolver now utilizes interactive plots using functions plotEPG2/plotMPS2/plotTopEPG2/plotTopMPS2 from the euroformix R-package (available from v2.2.0).
  -> Visualizing MPS data is now possible.
 - The MatchNetwork now also include an interactive plot (if plotly is installed)
 - In report: Evid profiles estimated as 1 contributors is now given under single source profiles.
 - The MatchMatrix is still calculated if popFreq not given (using loci from evid data)
 - GUI changes:
  -> In Data panel:
    - The "Functionalities" panel was moved above the tables. 
    - The button "Import Ref(s)" has been added: The user can import additional reference profiles to the case (requires a text file with genemapper format).
    - The button "Selected profiles" has been added: 
	-- Substituting the Deconvolution and Export button
	-- The selected/marked profiles in the tables can be selected for further operations: View/Export/Deconvolve/Delete
  -> In Deconvolution panel: The user can now export or remove selected candidates.
  -> In Matches panel: Dedicated "Show match networks" buttons were added to separate Mixture and Single source matches.
  -> "Mixtures" table now changed to "Matches".
  -> In Frequency file selection. The user can now deselect the frequency file ("Remove selected").

 - Minor changes:
   -- When closing window, the user is asked whether to quit instead of asked to save project.
   -- Create Report made more robust.
   -- A warning is given by user before running "Random IBS".
   -- New created project files becomes much smaller in size.
   -- Name changes: "Number of required optimizers (EFM)" instead of "Number of randoms in optimizer".

 - Bug fixes (thanks to Lourdes Prieto for finding these):
  -> In R-function tabToListRef: Reference allele names as NA caused problems.
  -> In R-function getMatchesLR in gui.R[Line 1528]: The matchlist argument of function calcQuanLRcomparison has to be a matrix.

#Changes version 1.4.1
- MatchNetwork not updated after running quanLR in second round when modeltype=(qual,both) (thanks to Vibeke Bertelsen for finding the scenario).
-> An additional column named "type" was added to the resCompLR object (indicates whether the LR is based on qual/quan model).
- Fixed bug when performing deconvolution ("Deconvolve All") when having fewer number of contributors than number of conditional references (thanks to Lourdes Prieto for finding the scenario).  
- Small fixes in report when no match results are given.

#Changes version 1.4.0
- Qual based LR made more robust: Optimizer now uses a start value out of 0.1,0.35,0.7 which maximizes likelihood function (instead of only 0.1).
- The user now has a choice whether to replace calculation when making a specific quan. LR calculations (up to user whether replacing LR or not). 
- The user can now choose whether the estimation of number of contributors should start with assuming one contributor (in "Advanced->Advanced options"). This is now default. Otherwise this will be the assigned number of contributors from the import.
- It is now possible to use project files between different users.
- Added sorting functionalities for different tables:
 -- The qualitative and quantitative Match lists can now be sorted wrt Evid and Ref names (in addition to LR values) 
 -- The Mixtures matchLists can now be sorted wrt Evid and Ref names (in addition to #id from data import) 
 -- Evidence profiles in the Data import table can now also be sorted wrt MatchStatus.
 -- The qualitative and quantitative matchLists can now be sorted wrt Evid and Ref names (in addition to LR values) 
- Minor bugs:
 -- The error caused when removing references such that only one remains is fixed. 
 -- The order of LRs for conditional contributors when evaluating with quan. model from Match List 1, was not always correct.

#Changes version 1.3.7
  - DC conditioned on partial REFS now returns candidate shows deconvolved REF suggests
  - LR for conditional references from Qual.MatchList now also shown. The LRs are based on the method last used.

#Changes version 1.3.6
  - BUG fixed in DC when conditoning on partial REFS.

#Changes version 1.3.5
  - BUGs fixed when no refs are imported in case (report and add_ref)

#Changes version 1.3.4
  - Homozygous genotypes for Y-markers are now given as only 1 allele for references.

#Changes version 1.3.3
  - Bug in ncol(matchMATGUI[]) when having 1 ref (and 1 mix).
  - Bug in getStructuredData when having 2 alleles for Y-markers.

#Changes version 1.3.2
 - Fixed bug in getStructuredData when having partial references by import.


#Changes version 1.3.1
 - Faster structuring of data. Still limit in number of evidence (need to loop through all evidence).
   -- The software now handles MANY references (more than 1e5 depending on the memory).
     -> Handled in "edit/add references" in that user must select a segment of references.

 - The IBS calculations:
	-- Using only references matched in MatchStatus if more than 10000.
	-- Utilizes the R-package big.memory for extended memory handling (optional).
	-- Using only markers also found in popFreq if specified.

 - Bug(s) fixed:
   -- After running qualLR+quanLR, crashes when reanalysing comparison with negative qualLR not in quan matchlist.


#Changes version 1.2.3

  #Added in report:
  - Option "Show Expected PH plots" has been added. If comparison is done, this will create EPG plots of the expected PH for all Mixtures with at least one matching reference (DC results also given if ran).

  #Added calculation/interpretation flexibilities:
  - Added button "Calculate Quan LRs" will caclulate the calculate the quantitative LR for all comparisons in the list. Results will come in Match list (Quan LR) - Final Mixture table will be updated wrt results.
  - From the list "Match list (Qual LR)", the user can now double click on a row to calculate Quan LR for a specific hypothesis (user specifies conditional references + numContr).
    -- Results will update the Match list (Quan LR) - Final Mixture table will be updated wrt results.
    -- The conditional references are now listed in the column after "numContr".
  - Added button in Mixtures "Deconvolve all samples" will automatically run DC for all samples.
  - "Deconvolution" added to Data panel. The user can now consider DC at any times.
   --  THe user can here select any number of replicates and condition of any refs as wanted.


  Minor updates:
  - The user is asked to restart the program when importing a new case if there were results from previous case.
  - The program asks user of saving project before crossing out window (Quit).
  - Graphical flexibility
    -- Added buttons in MatchMatrix (Change view, truncate values)
  - Y markers and other non-freq markers are no longer compared in match matrix (this earlier caused females to have small match comparisons).
   -- Now using loci specified in allele frequencies.
 - Under Setup->Model: Selecting model types now comes first.
 - Single alleles for Y-markers of unknowns from SS_evidence are not considered as homozygous anymore (checking if loc name starts with DY). 
   -- CODE: #if(av[1]==av[2] && (toupper(substr(loc,0,2))=="DY" || toupper(substr(loc,0,1))=="Y") ) av = av[1] 
 - "Add reference profile": The user can now edit the alleles of all references.
 - Added option in Report Layout:
   -- Optional whether to show "MatchStatus" column.   
 - Minor bug in Report fixed:  Mixture w/PH not shown when no SS given in data.


#Changes version 1.1.1
- A bug in the function calcHp has been fixed.

#Changes version 1.1.0
- The button "Change view" has been added to make it possible to view the allele data of evidence/reference vertically instead of horizontally 
- The user can now change model specification option for euroformix (degradation ON/OFF stutter ON/OFF)
  -> NB: AMEL locus is excluded if stutter=ON 
- The LR values for each comparison is labeled in the window "Deconvolution/Show expected peak heights". THe LR will be based on the last calculated one (Quan or Qual).

- The user can now use a frequency file with more loci systems than defined. Fixed by changing line 31 in calcQuanLRcomparison().

Thanks to Vibeke Bertelsen for discovering the following bugs:
- Bug when having only 1 match candidate in LR based comparison, when generating a report. Fixed by changing line 1299 and 1308 in gui().
- Bug when performing DC with locus drop-out: Fixed by changing line 843 in gui().
